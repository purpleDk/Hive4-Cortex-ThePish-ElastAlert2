name: Packetbeat Teste

# (Required)
# Type of alert.
# the spike rule type compares the number of events within two sliding windows to each other
type: spike

# (Required)
# Index to search, wildcard supported
index: packetbeat-*

# (Required one of _cur or _ref, spike specific)
# The minimum number of events that will trigger an alert
# For example, if there are only 2 events between 12:00 and 2:00, and 20 between 2:00 and 4:00
# _ref is 2 and _cur is 20, and the alert WILL fire because 20 is greater than threshold_cur and (_ref * spike_height)
threshold_cur: 5
threshold_ref: 1

# (Required, spike specific)
# The size of the window used to determine average event frequency
# We use two sliding windows each of size timeframe
# To measure the 'reference' rate and the current rate
timeframe:
  hours: 2

# (Required, spike specific)
# The spike rule matches when the current window contains spike_height times more
# events than the reference window
spike_height: 3

# (Required, spike specific)
# The direction of the spike
# 'up' matches only spikes, 'down' matches only troughs
# 'both' matches both spikes and troughs
spike_type: "up"

# (Required)
# A list of Elasticsearch filters used for find events
# These filters are joined with AND and nested in a filtered query
# For more info: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html
